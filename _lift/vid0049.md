video_notes: This is Kim Weston signing the Black National Anthem at Watts Stax in
  1973. For those who do not know Kim Weston was a Motown Artist who did a duet with
  Singer Marvin Gaye.
narrative: 'This video is a mashup, which features Kim Weston being introduced by
  Jessie Jackson at the Wattstax in 1972. Features shots of the crowd, followed by
  images that attempt to chronicle the experiences of Black Americans from slavery
  to the contemporary. At 2:31, the video cuts from Weston''s singing to a clip of
  King''s “Mountaintop” speech (through 3:44). Sonically, the video then segues into
  a performance of “Somebody Bigger Than You & I” (performer is Jimmy Jones, however,
  multiple versions were recorded by Elvis Presley, Whitney Houston, Mahalia Jackson,
  and numerous others). Only the first verse of “Lift Every Voice” is sung. '

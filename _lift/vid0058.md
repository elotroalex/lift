  Melba Moore - “Lift Every Voice and Sing” From the album “Soul Exposed” in 1990.

narrative: 'Video features the cover of Moore''s 1990 album, Soul Exposed, from which
  the song (it is the fifth track on the album) is taken. This version begins with
  Moore noting that she loves singing the song, but that she did not want to sing
  it alone anymore, so she invited a few friends to do so with her. “Let freedom ring”
  echoes throughout the song. She is accompanied first, by piano, but as the song
  advances, she is joined by other voices and instruments, building the song from
  a solo speaking voice to a group of voices and instruments. Various artists take
  turn in a call-and response style (“sing a song”).Only the first verse is performed. '

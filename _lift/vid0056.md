video_notes: "Video Title: Lift Every Voice and Sing - Al Green & Deniece Wiliams.
  In 1985 Miller High Life asked me  to come up with a \"meaningful\" project for
  Black History Month. I  decided to arrange and record a celebratory contemporary
  version of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\". I called good friends Al Green and Deniece
  Williams who agreed to sing the duet, backed by Patti Austin, Roberta Flack, Melba
  Moore and myself. \nThe band consisted of the studio musicians who made up John
  Belushi and Dan Ackroyd's Blues Brothers Band, along with other notable musicians,
  including the late great Yogi Horton and jazz legend Jon Faddis. One of my favorite
  arrangers, Leon Pendarvis penned the charts and was Musical Director. Husband and
  wife actors Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee provided the voice-over narration for the commercials.
  \nRecorded in New York at Clinton Studios, it started out as a jingle but ended
  up a full length recording. \n\nThis is the actual video from the recording session.
  Al was 8 hours late as usual, which is why it's dark when he's arriving. It's a
  fun-filled sneak peek inside what goes on (or used to go on) in the recording studio.
  Enjoy!\n\nCheck out more jingles and celebrity photos on my Facebook \"Deborah McDuffie\"

narrative: This video, more than 10 minutes long, documents the making of the song
  at the Clinton Recording Studio. Commentary (see Notes) was provided by Deborah
  McDuffie, credited with being the first female composer/producer in the advertising
  industry (Mingo-Jones). Video commentary is provide by Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis.
  The singers record the first verse (in this clip).

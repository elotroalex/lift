narrative: From the 1979 album, Symphonic Spirituals, Columbia; conducted by Dr. Paul
  Freeman, narrated by Barbara Jordan, soloist William Brown, tenor (information from
  Album cover). Jordan includes a preamble to the dramatic recitation of the song,
  in which she intones, “These are our songs of joy and sadness. They were given life
  by slaves who toiled in the fields of America. Sweat on their brows, hope in their
  hearts.These are our songs of happiness and sorrow. The sould of blackfolk, coupled
  with religious fervor and vigorous rhythms that hint of their African heritage.
  These are our songs of hope.” The video features various still images of Jordan.
  She performs the first and second verses, and changes some of the words and adds
  her own “prayer” to the performance.

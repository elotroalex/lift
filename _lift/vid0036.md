notes: This  arrangement was created by Lawrence Watson and produced by Miklos Malek.
  It was first inspired by a late night at "Turner's Fisheries" a cabaret that once
  existed in the Westin Hotel in Boston. That Night Larry Watson, Billy Kilson, Vince
  Evans and Archie Kubota were improvising and Larry Watson started to sing this Anthem.  Watson
  has sung the song all over the world. He associates this arrangement with the release
  of Nelson Mandela from 27 years of incarceration. Recently Larry Watson provided
  the entertainment for the kick off fundraiser for Governor Patricks' re election.
  President Obama was the key note speaker and Watson got to shake his hand. Two history
  makers in the room at the same time. "Let us March on Till Victory is won."

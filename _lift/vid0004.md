notes: Black history month is a month set aside for us to reflect on the past from
  which we've come. Black History Month is very important to not only the African
  American Race, but to all races. So many years have passed and still there are a
  great number of us who are filled with hatred and envy. The dream of Dr. Martin
  Luther King Jr. has certainly come true in many areas, however, we are still not
  there - and we have a long way to go. Let us love one another and please keep the
  &quot;dream&quot; alive.

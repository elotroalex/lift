notes: 'In 2008 Rene Marie was asked to sing the National Anthem at Denver''s State
  of the City address.  The outcome was Rene singing "Lift Ev''ry Voice and Sing",
  "the black national anthem" to the tune of The Star Spangled Banner. This caused
  a firestorm of controversy. This clip is taken from Rene Marie''s performance the
  Bridgestone Music Festival. Her version of "Lift Ev''ry Voice & Sing/ Star Spangled
  Banner" can be found on her Motema album "Voice of My Beautiful Country":'

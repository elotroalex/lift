notes: It’s called the Black National Anthem. First penned as a poem in 1900, Lift
  Ev’ry Voice and Sing is the melodic cornerstone of the African-American experience—a
  quiet but steadfast declaration of the pain and resilience of our ancestors. In
  a moment in time when the very word anthem stirs debate and controversy, Lift E’vry
  Voice and Sing is singular and unmistakable in its message of hope. Filmed on the
  grounds of the Monticello, Thomas Jefferson’s former plantation, Aloe Blacc’s modern-day
  rendition speaks to the struggle today in the new civil rights era, with a brilliant
  reimagining of what the present offers and the future holds.

notes: Lift every voice and sing 'Til earth and heaven ring Ring with the harmony
  of Liberty Let our rejoicing rise High as the listening skies Let it resound loud
  as the rolling sea Sing a song full of the faith That our dark past has taught us
  Sing a song full of the hope That the present has brought us Facing the rising sun
  Of a new day begun Let us march on 'til victory is won!
narrative: 'Franklin: "ring with the harmony of dignity"; she also transponses some
  lines. Calls on the audience to sing: "Everyone sing..."'

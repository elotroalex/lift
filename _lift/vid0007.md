notes: Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School is home to a first-of-its-kind
  student-run record label, managed through a strategic alliance with Warner Music
  Nashville and a state-of-the-art recording studio. The recording studio is designed
  and equipped with support from The Recording Academy's Producers and Engineers Wing,
  Steven Durr Designs and features equipment from audio manufacturers, including Harman
  Professional, which includes the JBL/AKG/ and Lexicon brands; API; Audio-Technica;
  Fredenstein Professional Audio; Shure, Inc.; Solid State Logic and Prometheus Charitable
  Trust. The Recording Studio also acknowledges a groundbreaking Federal grant from
  the Magnet Schools Assistance Program, which established Pearl-Cohn as the only
  entertainment magnet high school in the country in 2010. The new music industry
  pathway at Pearl-Cohn is a component of Music Makes Us, a joint effort of Metro
  Nashville Public Schools, Mayor Karl Dean and music industry and community leaders,
  to lead the nation in music education. With a focus on music literacy and student
  participation, Music Makes Us is strengthening traditional school music while adding
  a contemporary curriculum that embraces new technologies and reflects a diverse
  musical landscape.

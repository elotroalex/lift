narrative: The video was directed by Debbie Allen. It begins with a soliloquy by Louis
  Gossett, Jr. The video features noted African American singers such as Dionne Warwick,
  BeBe Winans, Jeffrey Osborne, Bobby Brown (who also dances), and others, and includes
  dancing by Jasmine Guy. All of the performers are dressed in white and are positioned
  in front of a fuschia background with light blue steps on which they stand or sit.
  Three to four male dancers accompany Guy, who dances around the singers. A small
  chorus of children, also dressed in white, join the singers and dancers. Only the
  first and third verses of the song are performed (See Jessika Banzouzi, Aloe Blacc).
  The video ends with Gossett intoning, “keep hope alive.”

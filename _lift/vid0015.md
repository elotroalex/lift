narrative: Appears to be a tv show called “Entertainment Tonight” with host, Leeza
  Gibbons. Dressed in white, including a white hat, Houston performs as the credits
  roll quickly across the screen. She hums along to the music before finally saying,
  “I forgot the words.” However, she locates the end of the first verse, belting out,
  “facing the rising sun...” A digitized version of the American flag flashes across
  the screen. Filmed in 1988.
rights: Paramount Pictures Corp., 1988.

video_title: "“Lift Every Voice and Sing”"
video_notes: In honor of Martin Luther King Day, MPrynt sings a special rendition
  of the Black Natioal Anthem
narrative: MPrynt, a four-part harmonic group; a cappella performance. The group recorded
  the song in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday observation. The song
  appears to have been recorded in a building hallyway (possibly a school, or apartment
  building). One commenter (Roscoe J, comments section) notes the irony of the sounds
  of sirens in the background of the performance of this song by young black men.
  User Prince Philipps responds “gave me chills.” They sing only the first verse.

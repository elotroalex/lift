narrative: Performing in Baltimore, the group serves as the opening act for an R.
  Kelly show. Kristall notes that the group was asked recently to perform the national
  anthem at a celebrity basketball tournament. They had not heard of the song before.
  They ask the audience to stand; audience members can be heard in the background
  refusing to stand, laughing. Audience members continue to talk throughout the performance.
  Comments section expresses displeasure at audience speaking throughout the performance.
  June's Diary members remind the audience to vote. They sing only the first verse.

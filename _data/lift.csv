Black History Month is very important to not only the African American Race, but to all races. So many years have passed and still there are a great number of us who are filled with hatred and envy. The dream of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has certainly come true in many areas, however, we are still not there - and we have a long way to go.

The tune (...) is now thought to have been written ""collectively"" by members of the society, led by John Stafford Smith (...). The society met every two weeks to get drunk, sing songs and to indulge in some debauchery. Anacreon himself was a Greek poet from about 570BC who was noted for his erotic poetry (...) and his drinking songs. To Anacreon in Heav'n, where he sat in full glee, A few sons of harmony sent in a petition That he their Inspirer and patron would be; When this answer arriv'd from the Jolly Old Grecian ""Voice, fiddle and flute, ""no longer be mute, ""I'll lend you my name and inspire you to boot, ""And, besides, I'll instruct you, like me, to intwine ""The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine."" (...) Ye Sons of Anacreon, then join hand in hand; Preserve unanimity, friendship and love! 'Tis yours to support what's so happily plann'd; You've the sanction of Gods and the fiat of Jove. While thus we agree Our toast let it be: ""May our club flourish happy, united and free! ""And long may the sons of Anacreon intwine ""The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.""

vid0027,7th Element- Lift Every Voice,7th Element,"March 14, 2010",www.youtube.com/embed/YWLb4o7Vbjc,5:22,Evertone Siwela,"Here are six Christian men from Orlando, Florida, whose God, the '7th Element,' has called them to minister to others, to reach peoples' hearts with a positive message in music. David 'Dee' Glover, Marc Dwyer, Darren Greene, Garth, Curt and Kevin perform their mission well. In a way, 7th Element has actually been in the making for decades. ""Four of the guys in the group, Garth, Kevin, Darren and Curt Greene, are brothers. it's clear as they break into a stunning harmonic jazz chord that 7th Element is something very special. Vol. I album, has several songs written and arranged by the group members, with very cool with little spoken set pieces.Beautiful, soaring falsetto voices and cutting edge arrangements make 'Vol. I' as impressive as any well accomplished a cappella group. Volume One, has already drawn comparisons to multi-GRAMMY winning and platinum-selling artist, Take 6, and garnering high praise for expanding Take 6's legacy by venturing into new and cutting-edge forms. When it came time to choose a name for their new group, the members of 7th Element wanted the glory going to Christ rather than to themselves as individuals. Marc comments, ""We figured that each of us came together to be an important element in the harmony, but the most important one was the Lord. So, each of us took a number, Element one through Element six, and we gave Christ his holy number, Element Seven. Thus, the group is named after the 7th Element."" Group members felt especially compelled to honor Christ through their name and their music because they say none of this would have ever happened without some amazing and timely divine intervention. 7th Element's diverse sound, its uncompromising message, and the astounding talent of each individual member has already fueled an incredible demand for appearances, with requests already pouring in from cities nationwide, as well as from three countries in Europe. In addition to their musical pursuits, group members have also set up the E7 Youth Development Group, in order to help young people get an education and pursue their dreams in music. Every copy of Volume One sold will help fund the non-profit organization, which will provide several deserving children each year with the money for a Christian education. In addition, the E7 Youth Development Group has a mentorship program to help aspiring artists. Group members will sponsor young musicians, flying the students to Orlando, taking them to Disney World, giving them a behind-the-scenes glimpse of performances, and buying them music equipment of their own to help advance their careers. Through their long history, the divine grace that brought them together, and their desire to help others through their musical success, the members of 7th Element have created a strong new future for themselves, a success story that no doubt will have many volumes. As David sums up, ""We just want others to understand that you don't have to compromise your faith in God to be successful. We are not just singers but professionals and family men. We want to be an example through our lives, showing others that there is value in doing things the right way, God's way. Our youth need to see that. Through our music and the E7 Youth Development Group, that's the message we hope to portray."" Lift every voice and sing, 'Til earth and heaven ring, Ring with the harmonies of Liberty; Let our rejoicing rise High as the listening skies, Let it resound loud as the rolling sea. Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us, Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us; Facing the rising sun of our new day begun, Let us march on 'til victory is won. Stony the road we trod, Bitter the chast'ning rod, Felt in the days when hope unborn had died; Yet with a steady beat, Have not our weary feet Come to the place for which our fathers sighed? We have come over a way that with tears has been watered, We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered, Out from the gloomy past, 'Til now we stand at last Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast. God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, Thou who has brought us thus far on the way; Thou who has by Thy might Led us into the light, Keep us forever in the path, we pray. Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee, Lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee; Shadowed beneath Thy hand, May we forever stand, True to our God, True to our native land.",,,,,,

The String Queens at Monticello | The Undefeated,Aloe Blacc,"Feb 3, 2019",www.youtube.com/embed/01RqzNGcacM,2:59,ESPN,"It’s called the Black National Anthem. First penned as a poem in 1900, Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing is the melodic cornerstone of the African-American experience—a quiet but steadfast declaration of the pain and resilience of our ancestors. In a moment in time when the very word anthem stirs debate and controversy, Lift E’vry Voice and Sing is singular and unmistakable in its message of hope. Filmed on the grounds of the Monticello, Thomas Jefferson’s former plantation, Aloe Blacc’s modern-day rendition speaks to the struggle today in the new civil rights era, with a brilliant reimagining of what the present offers and the future holds.",,ESPN,,,,
